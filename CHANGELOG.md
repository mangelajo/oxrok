  types, plus driver defined keys.
- Data feed packets, the `Driver` and `Device` traits with a per device
  acquisition thread, and a `Session` that fans packets out.

  `walking-one`, `walking-zero`, `all-low`, `all-high`, `graycode` and the
  analog patterns `square`, `sine`, `triangle`, `sawtooth`, `random`,
  with amplitude, offset, averaging and frame limits.
- Outputs `bits`, `hex`, `ascii` and `analog`, byte compatible with
  sigrok-cli after the header line.
- Command line: `--scan`, `--show`, `-d`, `-c`, `-C`, `-g`, `-t` with
  several stages, `--samples`, `--time`, `--frames`, `--continuous`,
