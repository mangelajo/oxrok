//! Core types of oxrok, a sigrok compatible logic analyzer stack.
//!
//! This crate holds everything a driver, a file format or a front end
//! needs to talk to each other:
//!
//! - [`Key`] and [`Value`]: the configuration model. The well known
//!   sigrok keys are variants with their sigrok ids, and a driver can add
//!   its own with [`Key::Custom`].
//! - [`Packet`]: the data feed. Drivers produce packets, outputs and
//!   decoders consume them.
//! - [`Driver`] and [`Device`]: the hardware contract. A device owns its
//!   acquisition thread and sends packets through a [`PacketSink`].
//! - [`Session`]: runs one or more devices and fans their packets out.
//! - [`util`]: parsing and formatting helpers shared by the CLI and the
//!   formats (sample rate strings, size suffixes, time strings).
//!
//! Nothing here touches USB or files. Those live in their own crates.
