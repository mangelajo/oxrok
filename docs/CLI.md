# The oxrok command line

`oxrok` accepts the sigrok-cli flags for the common flows and prints the
same output, byte for byte after the first header line (which names the
tool). The reference is sigrok-cli 0.8.0-git with libsigrok 0.6.0-git
(the current upstream code); `tools/diffcli.sh` runs the documented
flows through both tools and diffs them. Where 0.5.2 differed (the CSV
time column started one period late, the VCD body had no blank line
and single spaces), oxrok follows 0.6.

## Differences from sigrok-cli

Deliberate, and kept small:

- The header line of the logic outputs says `oxrok <version>` instead of
  `libsigrok <version>`. Same for `$version` and `$scope` in VCD files,
  `sigrok version` in session metadata and the CSV comment header.
  libsigrok's VCD reader prefixes the scope name to the channels of a
  file oxrok wrote (`oxrok.D0`); oxrok's reader treats both scope names
  as its own.
- `META samplerate: N` lines are printed only when the `analog` output
  is selected with `-O analog`. sigrok-cli prints them whenever a file
  input or a driver reports a sample rate, even into binary output.
- Analog packets go to the `analog` output only when the selected output
  cannot show them (`bits`, `hex`, `ascii`, `binary`). sigrok-cli also
  prints stray `A0: ...` lines next to `csv` and `vcd` output.
- The `binary` input parses `samplerate=200k` as 200 kHz. sigrok-cli
  reads it as 200 Hz, since it ignores the suffix for this option.
- The VCD input reads undefined bits (`x`, `z`, `u`, `-`) as 0 with one
  warning. sigrok-cli stops with an error. `--strict` turns every
  warning into a failed run, at any `-l` level, which gives the
  sigrok-cli behaviour for scripts that want it.
- Triggers: `-t` takes several stages separated by `;`, e.g.
  `-t 'D0=r;D1=1'`. One stage is written as in sigrok-cli. On top of
  that, when the device supports it (the parser rejects what it does
  not):
  - `D0=r*5` fires on the fifth rising edge, `D0=r*5c` on the fifth in
    a row: an edge while the stage's other conditions do not hold starts
    the count over.
  - `D0=1>100` fires once D0 has been high for more than 100 samples,
    `D0=1>50us` with a time, converted with the sample rate set by `-c`
    (in state mode, clock cycles).
  - `D0-D2=3..5` fires while the value on D2 D1 D0 (D0 least
    significant) is within 3..5, `D0-D2=!7` while it is not 7. Decimal
    or `0x` hex.
  - `D0=r|D1=r` fires on either stage, `D0=r&D1=r` once both have fired
    in any order. Exactly two stages.

  Counts, durations and ranges belong to the stage their token is in.
  The demo and fx2lafw devices (software trigger) take counts and
  durations; the LogicPort takes all of them with two stages, see
  `docs/DEVICES.md`. sigrok-cli rejects these forms. `>`, `;`, `|` and
  `&` need quoting in a shell.
- The demo device honours triggers (sigrok's ignores them): samples
  before the trigger are dropped, except the capture ratio's share of
  the sample limit, and the trigger is marked in the output.
- `--show` marks the current value in a float range list such as the
  LogicPort's `voltage_threshold`. sigrok-cli computes that list by
  accumulating the step, so its values never equal the current one and
  it marks none.
- `-I module --show` and `-O module --show` print the same option
  names with oxrok's own wording.
- `fx2lafw` sends frame packets only when `limit_frames` is not 1.
  libsigrok wraps every capture in a frame and re-arms once more before
  stopping, so its `bits` output ends with `FRAME-END` and
  `FRAME-BEGIN` lines.
- The demo device's default logic pattern is `oxrok`, a bitmap of that
  word. The other pattern names are the same. Disabled channels read low
  individually; sigrok's demo masks by the number of enabled channels.
- A `.sr` file written by oxrok is created when the first data arrives
  and finished at the end of the capture, in one pass. sigrok-cli reopens
  the archive for every chunk.

- `--protocol-decoder-jsontrace`. Python decoders need the `python`
  build feature; `docs/DECODERS.md`.
- `-T` (transform modules), `--list-supported-wiki`, the `gnuplot` and
  `scale` options of the `csv` output.
- The `csv` input and the other long tail input modules (ChronoVu LA8,
  STF, Trace32, ISF, WAV, LogicPort .lpf).
- fx2lafw and the other hardware drivers: phase 4 of the roadmap.
