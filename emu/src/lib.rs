//! Device emulation over USB/IP.
//!
//! A device is a [`model::DeviceModel`]: descriptors, control
//! transfers, OUT and IN transfers, reset. Plain Rust with no I/O, so
//! the same model runs in a unit test, on this server and, later, on a
//! microcontroller. [`device::Device`] wraps a model with the standard
//! requests every USB device answers (descriptors, configuration,
//! status, halts) and the checks on what the host sends. [`shells`]
//! carry what every device of a kind shares (HID so far), and
//! [`models`] holds the devices, one file each, found by `build.rs`.
//! [`usbip`] is
//! the USB/IP server the Linux `vhci-hcd` module connects to, and
//! [`vhci`] attaches and detaches through its sysfs files, so no
//! `usbip` tool is needed. Everything the host does goes to a
//! [`txlog::TxLog`]: one line per completed transfer, in the dialect
//! of oxrok's USB fixtures, and a `! violation:` line whenever the
//! host leaves the protocol as the model defines it.
//!
//! Only Linux can attach the device; the models and the protocol code
//! build and test everywhere.
