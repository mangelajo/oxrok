//! The CDC-ACM shell: a serial instrument the kernel's `cdc_acm` binds,
//! which the tools reach through `/dev/ttyACMn`.
//!
//! A model implements [`Serial`], a byte stream, and never sees a URB:
//! [`Serial::received`] gets what the host wrote and answers through
//! [`Port::send`]; [`Port`] also says how the line is set and how DTR and
//! RTS stand. [`Cdc`] is the [`DeviceModel`] around it: the descriptors
//! (a control interface with the header, call management, ACM and union
//! functional descriptors and a notification endpoint, a data interface
//! with bulk IN and OUT), the class requests and the checks on them.
//!
//! ```text
//! impl Serial for Meter {
//!     fn received(&mut self, data: &[u8], port: &mut Port<'_>) {
//!         port.send(b"reply");
//!     }
//! }
//! let id = Identity::new(0x1234, 0x5678, "Maker", "Meter");
//! Box::new(Cdc::new(NAME, &id, faults, Meter))
//! ```
//!
//! What the kernel does (`drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c`, 7.2), which is
//! what a model sees through this shell:
//!
//! - At probe, one `SET_LINE_CODING` of 9600/8n1.
//! - While the tty is open, 16 bulk IN transfers of two packets each and
//!   one interrupt IN are pending; [`Port::send`]'s bytes complete the
//!   oldest. Closed, none is, so nothing moves and [`Serial::tick`]
//!   stands still.
//! - Each open sends `SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE` 3, unless the speed is B0,
//!   whatever the lines were: see [`LineEvent::opened`]. The last close
//!   sends 0 only under `HUPCL`, which libserialport clears, so at a
//!   reopen DTR does not rise.
//! - The driver sends `SET_LINE_CODING` only when the settings differ
//!   from those it last sent, and termios outlives a close, so what a
//!   tool causes depends on the tool before it. `tools/diffcli.sh` puts
//!   the tty back at 9600/8n1 before each run, which is also what a fresh
//!   model assumes.
//! - One `write()` is one bulk OUT of up to 20 packets. The chunks mean
//!   nothing: the harness joins them in a `.tx`.
//! - `GET_LINE_CODING` is never sent; the shell answers it for a usbfs
//!   tool.
//!
//! Time in this shell is counted in the host's offers, never the clock.
//! Every model takes the [`Faults`] options, all off by default.
