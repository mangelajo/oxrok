//! - [`hid`]: the HID class descriptor, the report descriptor fetch and
//!   the class requests (`GET_REPORT`, `SET_REPORT`, idle, protocol).
//!
//! The FTDI shell (vendor requests, latency timer, the two modem
//! status bytes per packet) and the EZ-USB shell (firmware upload to
//! RAM, renumeration) come next; CDC-ACM and USBTMC after them
//! (`docs/ROADMAP.md`, "Emulation plan").
